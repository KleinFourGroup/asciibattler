/**
 * U1 — the wave resolver: a pure `resolveWave(spec, context, rng) → UnitTemplate[]`.
 *
 * The keystone primitive of the encounter model (ROADMAP §"Phase U"). An
 * encounter's per-turn enemy team used to come from the random `rollEnemyWave`
 * ([../enemyBudget.ts](../enemyBudget.ts)); the encounter model replaces that
 * call site with this authored resolver. Each turn's team is described by a
 * **wave spec** (a budget, a total count, and a list of unit types each with a
 * count- and level-contribution) and resolved deterministically against the
 * battle RNG.
 *
 * **Two-step resolution** (the brief's worked example is the contract — encoded
 * as a test):
 *
 *  1. **Count.** Resolve the total count `C` (fixed, or `hand × factor`). Fixed-
 *     count units always take their fixed count; the remainder `max(0, C −
 *     Σfixed)` is split across the weight-count units in proportion to weight via
 *     the deterministic largest-remainder (Hamilton) method — NO RNG, mirroring
 *     `rollEnemyWave`'s deterministic `Math.round` archetype split. If fixed
 *     counts exceed `C`, the weight-count units resolve to 0 (allowed).
 *
 *  2. **Level.** Resolve the total level budget `L` (fixed, or `mean|median ×
 *     factor` over the roster). Fixed-level instances pin to their authored level
 *     (honoured even above the cap — an authored elite is intentional); the
 *     remaining budget `L − Σ(fixed levels)` is spread across the **weight-level
 *     instances** in proportion to weight, **per instance** (the user-locked
 *     semantics: a type's level-weight makes ITS individuals spikier), each
 *     clamped to `[1, cap]` where `cap` is the wave's optional `levelCap`
 *     (absent = unbounded — `Infinity`). This is `distributeWeightedLevels` — a strict
 *     generalization of `distributeBudget`: with uniform weights it reduces to
 *     the same tight even split (spread ≤ 1, RNG-chosen remainder), so the
 *     reproduction encounter stays faithful to today's fights.
 *
 * Pure: no `Run`/snapshot touch, fully headless-testable. The only RNG draw is
 * the level remainder (the count step is deterministic) — so a wave is
 * reproducible from its seed + context, exactly where `rollEnemyWave`'s draw
 * sits today. NOT byte-identical to `rollEnemyWave` (it loses the random swarm
 * COUNT — the encounter authors count explicitly), which is why balance is
 * re-derived in Phase X, not re-confirmed.
