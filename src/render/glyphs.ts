/**
 * The registered glyph set for the font atlas. Lives in its own module —
 * deliberately free of any THREE / DOM dependency — so it can be imported
 * by both `FontAtlas.ts` (which builds the canvas atlas) and headless
 * vitest tests (which can't touch canvas/WebGL).
 *
 * §38e — the KEYSTONE payoff: the **unit** glyphs are now DERIVED from the
 * `config/units.json` catalog (`ALL_UNIT_DEFS`) rather than hand-listed here, so
 * authoring a brand-new unit in the archetype editor renders with **no code
 * edit** — the last code-edit dependency the unit-data keystone set out to
 * remove. Only the NON-unit glyphs (the root marker, the numeric HUD
 * digits/punctuation, the projectile tracer, the objective marker) stay a static
 * list, since nothing in the catalog owns them.
 *
 * EVERY glyph the renderer asks for must appear in the exported `GLYPHS` or
 * `FontAtlas.getGlyphUV` throws at render time. Unit-glyph coverage is now
 * STRUCTURAL (a catalog entry's glyph is in the set by construction — it can't
 * drift), so `FontAtlas.test.ts` only has to guard the two things left: the
 * derived set fits the atlas grid, and the static non-unit glyphs are present.
 *
 * The atlas is rebuilt from this list every boot and UVs are addressed by the
 * glyph char (not by index), so ordering is free — but the count must stay under
 * `ATLAS_CELL_BUDGET` (the `COLS × ROWS` grid in FontAtlas).
