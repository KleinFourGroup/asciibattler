# Scratchpad — rolling notes on process, decisions, gotchas

Running notebook of "things worth talking about" — drop short observations here
as you build. **Swept at every round/cluster boundary** by the distillation
ritual (AGENTS.md §"The planning stack"): each entry gets **promoted** (to
AGENTS / GOTCHAS / TESTING / TODO) or **archived** with the round's docs, so
this file holds only undistilled observations from the current round. Keep
entries short; link commits; group by theme.

Prior eras: the MVP→H7 backlog was swept 2026-07-06 (the ritual's first run) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-mvp-to-h7.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-mvp-to-h7.md);
the process-audit + Cluster-3 backlog was swept 2026-07-11 (the second run, at
the micro-round kickoff) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-3.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-3.md);
the micro-round backlog was swept 2026-07-21 (the third run, at the Cluster-4
kickoff) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-micro-round.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-micro-round.md);
the Cluster-4 backlog was swept 2026-07-29 (the fourth run, at the 68h round
close) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-4.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-4.md);
the rollout-arbitration-interstitial backlog was swept 2026-08-04 (the fifth
run, at the 72f round close) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-rollout-arbitration.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-rollout-arbitration.md);
the Cluster-5 backlog was swept 2026-08-21 (the sixth run, at the §83g
cluster close) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-5.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-cluster-5.md);
the Round-6 (Instruments) backlog was swept 2026-09-02 (the seventh run, at
the 88e round close — promoted: six norms to AGENTS [the macro-plan code
audit · count-the-shape-before-timing + profile-between-levers · the
paired-bench warm-leg/subshell rule · verify-the-tree-died after any kill +
no `pgrep` in Git Bash · poll scales to batch size · adversarial review +
a read-only verifying peer], one caveat to BALANCE [exact zeros = an
instrument smell]) →
[archive/retro-scratchpad-round-6.md](../archive/retro-scratchpad-round-6.md);
the casualty-experiment (§89–§94) backlog was swept 2026-09-08 (the eighth
run, at the §94i close — promoted: five norms to AGENTS [the worktree build
under a cohort · Write/Edit for quote-bearing text · self-check a reader +
pool by script · pre-sign the chain · a knob pin through the resolver + the
first live read of an inert-by-design mechanism]) →

## The close ritual

- **A round close without a playtest ships its presentation findings to
  the next round's first playtest** (2026-09-10, the §95 playtest — the
  first since §94 closed; the user: "clearly I forgot to do a playtest
  then"). The §94 close had a signed sheet, a frozen config and a
  fallen-ledger screen nobody had looked at in a live run: two findings
  (the morale chip doubling the HUD/turn-screen gauges; the 94d
  shape-lock's live bar NEVER BUILT — it fell through the data/
  presentation split, with no TODO or roadmap line to catch it) cost
  nothing to find and an inserted phase (§96.5) to fix. Candidate norm
  for the close ritual (AGENTS "The round close ritual"): the close
  PROPOSES a playtest as a step, and a shape-lock note that splits a
  step into "data now, presentation later" writes the deferred half
  into TODO in the same commit (the 47c landing-note rule, applied to
  a user's idea instead of a code seam).
