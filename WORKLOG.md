# WORKLOG — The encounter feel interstitial (§89–§94): the casualty experiment

Per-round narrative log (AGENTS "The planning stack"): findings, decision
rationale, rejected alternatives, scope changes, playtest verdicts land
here under the matching `## Phase N`; the ROADMAP stays a plan (one-line
mutations + a pointer back here). Created 2026-09-02 at the Round 6
close (88e); the spec is [encounter-feel-spec.md](encounter-feel-spec.md).
Prior round's log: [archive/post-83-worklog.md](archive/post-83-worklog.md)
(Round 6, Instruments — §84 the shadow instrument → §85 the fold → §86
perf → §87 roster realism → §88 the rarity read + the close).

## Kickoff (2026-09-02 — the spec session; resolutions USER-SIGNED in chat)

### The code-reality audit (before the design conversation)

- **Inter-sector healing does not exist.** `advanceSector` (Run.ts
  ~3496) swaps sector state and never touches `playerHealth`; the only
  heals are rest (+5 absolute), Patch (+6), and `healPool` ops. Pool max
  20; the signed seam band 15–18 ⇒ a seam heal is worth +2..+5 on
  average — less than one act-2 elite. Cheap to build (a knob + a line +
  a SectorClearedScreen line, no bump); the real cost is that the sheet
  defines the run as ONE budget, so a seam heal retires the seam band.
- **No per-act difficulty knob exists.** `difficulty.json` multipliers
  are per RUN; act 2 is hot only because its encounters are authored
  hotter. "Per-act bands" is purely a target question.
- **The §87d defect list splits** into members off-band under EITHER
  answer to the act question (act-1 normals 0.03–1 · warband-vanguard
  1.18/0.95 · plagueVictims 0.03 · infernalColumn 7.7 / miscreants 6.9
  above the ELITE band · plagueSpreaders 10.6/9.3) and members off-band
  only under the single band (elementalTrio · act-2 artillery /
  adventurer · plagueDoctors 0.3–1.8).
- **The King is probably not a defect:** isolation 5.97 vs the prose
  band 10, but his full-length wall reads 33% — INSIDE the signed 30–35.
  Tuning him to the isolation band would breach a signed band to
  satisfy a prose one → bosses are judged by the wall.
- **Isolation reads run on the extended searcher arm** (`--arbitrate` ⊥
  `--encounter`, the 84b refusal) — every per-encounter tune reads on a
  slightly weaker bot than the board; the exit board is load-bearing.
- **Packets today:** rarity-by-SOURCE already exists (small/large/
  elite/boss tables at 30/50/75% triggers); the one uniform surface is
  the port shelf (`rollPortStock`: `sampleDistinct` 5 of 8, Venom at 15
  beside Patch); prices per id 5–15. Unit rarity is the analog (tier
  field · `rarityWeights` · Portunus forced tiers · the P1 card seam).
- **The chip formula** (`resolveTurn`, Run.ts ~3009): each side's pool
  loses the OPPOSING survivors' Σ`power` × `chipMultiplier`(1). `power`
  base 1, growth 0.1/level (L10 ≈ 1.9); enemy pools 7–10; a winning hand
  chips ~7.5 ⇒ encounters are 1–2 turns; a lost turn vs 6–8 survivors
  chips 11–15 of 20. Per-turn `poolChips` telemetry (survivor power per
  side, per encounter, per hop) rides `--per-encounter`; `poolAtSectorClears`
  exists since 72b-pre. Only two fetched box batches remain on disk
  locally (whether the 87d2 cohort is re-analyzable = a §89 check).

### The design conversation — how the charter widened

The user's ramble decomposed into three problems sharing one symptom:
(1) **the per-turn tail** — the chip is linear in the winner's survivor
count, a won turn costs 0, so per-encounter pool damage is a spike at 0
plus a fat tail; (2) **the carry across acts** — the sheet already lives
at the "act 1 trivial" corner (seam 15–18 of 20); (3) **the run-shape
math** — with a fixed pool and no reset, act clear rates don't multiply,
so the exponential drop-off is unreachable and act 3 would have to be
numerically easier ("harder in win rate, easier in absolute terms" only
exists under coupling). Independence is also a MEASUREMENT property:
coupled acts make cost multiplicative (act 3 needs acts 1–2's residue
simulated faithfully); a known entry pool + the §87 sampled roster make
it additive. StS precedent: full heal after each act boss below
Ascension 5, removed as a rung — a free difficulty lever later.

**Resolved:** the seam floor (`seamHealFloor` 0–1, shipped 1.0). The user
declined the per-turn cap (a hidden number; "I liked that the player
could add the numbers") and asked for the root fix.

**The menu** (simple → radical): (1) HP-weighted survivors ("wounded push
less") · (2) **casualty-based chip** (each side pays its OWN fallen —
the body fills in, the ceiling is the player's own fielded power,
losses still progress the fight, the enemy pool becomes literal) · (3)
a retreat stance (only coherent under 2 — under survivors retreating
early leaves MORE survivors to chip you) · (4) more draws per encounter
(√n variance, a pacing price) · (5) injuries via the inert fatigue seam
· (6) drop the pool for persistent unit HP · (7) the exposed cap. The
user chose (2) — "there's no sense of a Pyrrhic victory in this game" —
and, recognizing the overhaul (power-on-level-up becomes a penalty;
pools rebalance; not a config switch), called **the first experimental
round**: build it regardless, rebalance, then ⛔ keep or roll back.

**The hardening pass** (the user's "what am I forgetting / what are you
unsure of" round) firmed: headcount weights 1 / legendary 2 / summon 0,
symmetric · heals as fractions (rest, floor) vs absolutes (packets) ·
the keep read on a RE-SEARCHED arm (the §85f leak shape) · the cap
penalty as its own mode from day one (the SEARCHER, not the player, is
the stall risk) · fatigue re-targeted to starting HP (−10%/stack, cap
50%), landed at rate 0 and read separately · main + tag, no branch ·
5 playtest runs per rule, feel verdict before numbers · per-act targets
0.6 / 0.5 / (0.4). The arithmetic's prediction — the PLAYER pool is the
knob, not the enemy pools (a decisive win chips the wave's power ≈
today's survivor chip; a won turn now costs its fallen) — is a
hypothesis for §91's flip read, not a premise.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Deciding the per-act band question first** — it dissolves under
  independence; the defect list then tunes to the single band per act.
- **A rarity tier axis for packets now** — the real need is a SHELF
  GUARANTEE (weights bias, they don't guarantee): a role tag + a forced
  slot, the recruit offer's melee+ranged precedent → Round 9 with the
  catalog growth it serves.
- **Massively increased heal drops** — the same variance fear.
- **An experiment branch** — the merge pain is a week of doc/BALANCE
  divergence; a tag + contiguous commits make the revert free.
- **Rule 4 as the variance fix** — a pacing question the rebalance
  answers by measurement.
- **Retreat / optional deploy / injuries now** — the phase is large
  enough; written into META-ROADMAP Round 9 with the anti-exploit
  constraint (walked to spawn + despawn, or an unlock timer, or both).

### The blind-spot register (→ the §91 kickoff audit)

Neutral exclusion from the survivor sum (camps) · summons at power 0 ·
the rollout evaluator's objective (survivor power as a chip proxy?) ·
the telemetry proxy (deltas must land WITH the rule) · XP on death · the
riders re-scope under keep vs rollback · box time 4–6 nights · snapshot
prediction NO bump for the round · exposure has no lever but Cull.

### Adversarial review (planned, reviewer unpinned)

The §85f tiger-team shape at the §91 kickoff — "the strongest available
second model at the time" + a read-only peer verifying file:line. Hunt:
pre-registration leaks (a criterion the bot can satisfy instead of the
rule) · confounded reads (two changes before one paired read) ·
inherited seams · rollback completeness · scope-creep vectors and
decisions not written as stops.

### Shape-lock (2026-09-02, USER-SIGNED in chat)

The six-phase cut (§89 data → §90 floor → §91 rule → §92 rebalance →
§93 ⛔ keep-or-rollback → §94 the list + the close) signed as proposed;
the adversarial review scheduled at the §91 kickoff (when the build's
cut lines exist to be attacked — movable earlier on request). Config
names (`chipMode` / `capPenalty` / `seamHealFloor`) and the tag name
are proposals until §91.
