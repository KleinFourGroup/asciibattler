/**
 * Run-level command channel. Carries the three player intents that used to
 * be bus-event imperatives (`run:nodeEntered`, `recruit:chosen`,
 * `run:resetRequested`). UI components no longer call `bus.emit(...)` for
 * these — they hold a `RunDispatcher` and call `dispatcher.dispatch(cmd)`.
 *
 * Why a dispatcher object rather than a direct `Run` reference: `Run` is
 * replaced on reset (Game.resetRun), so any UI that captured the old
 * instance would dispatch to a disposed run. The dispatcher closes over
 * `() => this.run` in Game and always resolves to the live one.
 *
 * Run processes commands synchronously (unlike `World.tick`, which drains
 * its queue at a tick boundary). Run isn't tick-driven — its lifecycle is
 * event-driven, so "apply now" is the natural semantic.
