/**
 * E1 — derive per-unit computed values from base stats + archetype
 * context. Pure functions: same inputs → same outputs, no RNG.
 *
 * I6 — crit left `deriveStats`: it is resolved PER-ABILITY at attack time via
 * `critChanceFor(ability.critBase, unit.stats.luck)` (gated on
 * `ability.critable`), so there is no per-unit `critChance` to derive. The
 * RNG crit roll still happens at action start/impact off `world.combatRng`;
 * only the probability's source moved (unit-derived → per-ability).
 *
 * Formula sources (`config/stats.json`):
 *
 *   maxHp                   = max(1, round(hpPerConstitution * constitution))
 *   moveCooldown            = max(1, secondsToTicks(baseMoveCD * cooldownScale(mobility, mobilityCdPerStat, mobilityMinCdScale)))
 *   cooldownScale(s, p, m)  = max(m, 1 - s * p)
 *   attackRange             = effective engagement range (max over the unit's
 *                             abilities, via `rangeForArchetype`), passed through verbatim
 *
 * The 1-tick cooldown floor catches future tuning where the min scale
 * or base values drop low enough to round to 0; at default config it's
 * unreachable.
 *
 * GP1: the two cadence stats drive cooldowns through SEPARATE per-axis
 * knobs so they can diverge — `mobility` (move CD) reads
 * `mobilityCdPerStat`/`mobilityMinCdScale`; `speed` (attack cadence; I1
 * reverted the GP1 `agility` name) reads `speedCdPerStat`/`speedMinCdScale`.
 * `cooldownScale` is now
 * parameterized over (perStat, minScale) and each call site threads its
 * own pair. `mobility` is signed: negative → scale > 1 → slower than the
 * baseline (the min-scale floor caps only the fast side). GP1 also
 * dropped the per-archetype `baseMoveCooldownSeconds` override — there's
 * one universal `STATS.baseMoveCooldownSeconds`, and a slow walk now
 * comes from low/negative mobility.
 *
 * E5 pre-work: attack cadence is NO LONGER derived here. It moved to
 * the Ability layer — a unit can carry several abilities with different
 * timings, so a single per-unit `attackCooldownTicks` couldn't
 * represent them. `attackCooldownTicksFor` resolves an ability's
 * `cooldownSeconds` (from `config/abilities.json`) against the unit's
 * `speed` at propose time, reusing the same `cooldownScale` curve.
 *
 * `inertDerived` is the environment-entity path (walls / half-cover) —
 * non-combatants need a maxHp anchor for HP display and the future
 * destructibility plumbing, but no cooldowns / crit / range.
 *
 * `basicAttackDamage` answers "which stat drives this unit's basic
 * strike?" — melee → strength, ranged → ranged. Lives here (not inside
 * AttackBehavior) so E2's Ability system can generalize the lookup to
 * a per-ability stat tag without duplicating the per-archetype switch.
