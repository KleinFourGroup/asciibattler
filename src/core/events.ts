/**
 * The canonical event catalog. Adding a new event? Add it here first so the
 * type system can guide every emitter and subscriber. Naming convention:
 * `subject:verbed` (past tense, lowercase, colon-separated).
 *
 * Mirrors ARCHITECTURE.md "Event catalog". When the two drift, this file
 * wins — but please update the doc in the same commit.
 *
 * A2: imperative inputs (player wants to enter a node, pick a recruit,
 * reset the run) moved off the bus and onto the `RunCommand` channel in
 * `src/run/Command.ts`. The bus carries only outputs ("X just happened")
 * — that's why every name here is past-tense.
