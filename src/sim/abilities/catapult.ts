/**
 * E7.D — the catapult's only ability. A slow, telegraphed wind-up that lobs
 * a single heavy shot at a locked target.
 *
 * The propose path is the ranged strike's MINUS the line-of-sight gate: the
 * catapult lobs an arcing shot OVER walls (E7.D decision — "ignores LOS"),
 * so it commits the moment a target is within range regardless of what's
 * between them. Find the committed target (`currentTarget`), gate on the
 * ability's own range, and propose — no `hasLineOfSight` check, unlike
 * `RangedShot`/`MagicBolt`.
 *
 * `ignoresLineOfSight = true` tells `MovementBehavior` the same thing: when
 * in range, abstain (let this fire) even with no LOS, instead of creeping
 * forward to clear a wall it doesn't need cleared.
 *
 * Multi-tick like the mage: `duration` is the full wind-up (cadence × speed
 * via `attackCooldownTicksFor`) and `effectTicks: [duration]` lands the shot
 * on the tick the charge completes, filling the action-progress bar.
 * `cooldown == duration`, so the catapult re-winds immediately after each
 * shot (a perpetual siege engine).
 *
 * The target is captured as the LIVE unit (homing) — `CatapultShotAction`
 * holds the reference and resolves damage at impact. Score is 10, same as
 * the strikes, enough to beat `MovementBehavior`'s 1.
