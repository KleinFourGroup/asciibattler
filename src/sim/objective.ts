/**
 * The in-battle objective model. O1 (Phase O) refactored J1's single nullable
 * player objective into a per-team, ALWAYS-PRESENT typed objective, separating
 * the MODE (what the team is doing) from the TARGET (where / who).
 *
 * `ObjectiveTarget` — the inner where/who (the old J1 `BattleObjective`,
 * unchanged in shape):
 *  - `enemy`: a specific enemy unit to converge on + kill.
 *  - `tile`:  a rally cell the team paths toward (an attractor — "as close as
 *    they can").
 *
 * `TeamObjective` — the always-present per-team wrapper. O1 shipped `atWill` +
 * `engage`; O2 adds `hold`; O3 adds `focus` (each extends this union + its
 * behavior branch):
 *  - `atWill` (the default): no target — default nearest-enemy targeting +
 *    normal pathing. BEHAVIORALLY IDENTICAL to J1's `objective === null`. A team
 *    reverts here when an `engage`/`focus` enemy target dies (J1's auto-clear,
 *    now "revert to at-will" rather than "set null").
 *  - `engage`: target = enemy or tile. The RTS attack-move — BEHAVIORALLY
 *    IDENTICAL to J1's set objective (leash-capped engage radius + retaliation;
 *    see `Targeting.updateObjectiveTarget`).
 *  - `hold` (O2): no target. Units STOP MOVING (`MovementBehavior` proposes no
 *    intent — no pursuit, no dash) but ACT IN PLACE: they target + attack any
 *    enemy ALREADY within their attack range (`Targeting.updateTarget`'s hold
 *    branch picks an in-range enemy or none). A held ranged unit fires at
 *    anything in reach; a held melee unit only strikes adjacent.
 *  - `focus` (O3): target = enemy or tile. Like `engage` but COMPLETELY
 *    PREEMPTS targeting + pathing — a unit ABANDONS its current fight (and eats
 *    hits from non-focused enemies; no retaliation break-off) to converge on
 *    the focus. An ENEMY focus = beeline to that unit, ignore everything else
 *    (`Targeting.updateFocusTarget`). A TILE focus is steered by the switchable
 *    `focusTileResolution` strategy (`src/sim/focusTile.ts`): disallow /
 *    clearOnArrival / leashAtNearest. A dead focus enemy reverts to `atWill`
 *    (mirrors engage); a tile focus reverts per its strategy.
 *
 * Stored per-team on `World` (`objectiveFor(team)`); the ENEMY team is fixed at
 * `atWill` for now (J1's "enemy AI never sets it"), but the storage is real and
 * the behaviors read the ACTING unit's team objective, so a future enemy
 * strategy is a data change, not a refactor. Set/cleared via the `setObjective`
 * / `clearObjective` `WorldCommand`s (the deterministic top-of-tick drain);
 * snapshotted (part of the WorldSnapshot).
