/**
 * Schema history:
 *   2 — C1a added tileGrid.
 *   3 — D3 replaced single `gridSize` with `gridW` + `gridH`.
 *   4 — D5.C added per-team `spawnQueue` (overflow UnitTemplate[]) +
 *       `spawnRegions` (each team's authoritative spawn region).
 *   5 — D6 added per-unit `blocksLineOfSight` (defaults `true` for
 *       combatants + walls; half-cover sets `false`).
 *   6 — E1 rewrote `UnitSnapshot.stats` to the new vocabulary
 *       (constitution / strength / ranged / magic / luck / speed /
 *       endurance), added `UnitSnapshot.archetype` + `.derived`, and
 *       added a top-level `combatRng` channel for AttackAction's
 *       start-time crit roll.
 *   7 — E2 added per-unit `abilities: string[]` (registry ids) so the
 *       new `AbilityBehavior` rehydrates the right concrete classes
 *       after round-trip. AttackBehavior retired; v6 `behaviors`
 *       arrays referencing `'attack'` would throw on rehydrate, but
 *       the version bump already rejects v6 wholesale.
 *   8 — E3 added per-unit `level: number` (combatant display metadata;
 *       defaults to 1 for environment entities). Spawn-queue templates
 *       gained a `level` field on the same bump (UnitTemplate is now
 *       `{archetype, level, stats}`). v7 throws on load.
 *   9 — E4 added the battle-scoped damage ledger
 *       (`damageDealt: [attackerId, total][]`) so a mid-battle snapshot
 *       round-trip preserves the XP awarded on battle:ended. Without
 *       round-trip, restoring a mid-battle world would start the
 *       ledger empty and a finished restored battle would award less
 *       XP than the un-roundtripped baseline — failing the
 *       snapshot-roundtrip determinism contract. v8 throws on load.
 *  10 — E4 added per-unit `xp: number` (display data; banked on the
 *       roster side post-battle) and `rosterIndex: number | null`
 *       (set for player units only; carried into `xpAwards` so Run
 *       can bank into the right slot). Spawn-queue templates also
 *       carry `xp` now. v9 throws on load.
 *  11 — E4 follow-up added `playerRosterIds: [unitId, rosterIndex][]`
 *       so a player unit that died during the battle still earns
 *       its damage-share XP plus the new `xpFlatPerFallen` slice.
 *       Without this, the dead unit's tally was orphaned at battle
 *       end because the unit was already spliced from `world.units`.
 *       v10 throws on load.
 *  12 — E5 pre-work removed `attackCooldownTicks` from
 *       `UnitSnapshot.derived` (the `UnitDerived` shape is stored
 *       verbatim). Attack cadence moved to the Ability layer, resolved
 *       from `config/abilities.json` at propose time, so the field no
 *       longer exists to serialize. v11 throws on load.
 *  14 — F2 replaced `ActiveActionSnapshot.effectTicks: number[]` with a
 *       declared `phases: {phase, ticks}[]` timeline (the action phase
 *       system). The impact tick is derived from the timeline rather than
 *       stored as a raw offset list. v13 (and earlier) throw on load. (v13
 *       was E5.A's `targetId`/`outOfLosTicks` add — see UnitSnapshot.)
 *  15 — F6 added the utility-contribution ledger
 *       (`utilityDone: [unitId, total][]`) — effective HP healed by
 *       ability casts — so a mid-battle round-trip preserves the heal-XP
 *       awarded on `battle:ended`. Without it a restored mid-battle world
 *       would start the ledger empty and under-award a healer's XP,
 *       failing the snapshot-roundtrip determinism contract (same reason
 *       v9 added `damageDealt`). v14 throws on load.
 *  16 — GP1 renamed two `UnitStats` keys (`speed → agility`, `endurance →
 *       mobility`). Stats round-trip as a whole object by key, so a v15
 *       snapshot carries the old key names and would deserialize into an
 *       `agility`/`mobility`-less stat block; the version check rejects it
 *       outright (no migration — the rename also re-tuned the move-CD curve,
 *       so old derived cadences wouldn't be reproduced anyway). v15 throws
 *       on load.
 *  17 — GP2 added the `defense` key to `UnitStats` (flat subtractive damage
 *       mitigation). Stats round-trip as a whole object by key, so a v16
 *       snapshot carries a `defense`-less stat block; the version check
 *       rejects it outright (no migration — defaulting the missing key would
 *       silently mis-derive nothing today, but the version bump keeps the
 *       stat-shape contract honest, same as GP1). v16 throws on load.
 *  18 — H1 added the `power` key to `UnitStats` (Phase-H pool-chip stat).
 *       Stats round-trip as a whole object by key, so a v17 snapshot carries a
 *       `power`-less stat block; the version check rejects it outright (no
 *       migration — same stat-shape-contract rationale as GP1/GP2). v17 throws
 *       on load.
 *  19 — I1 reverted the GP1 `agility → speed` rename and added two dodge keys
 *       (`precision`, `evasion`) to `UnitStats` (canonical order CON·STR·RNG·
 *       MAG·LCK·DEF·PRC·EVA·SPD·MOB·POW). Stats round-trip as a whole object by
 *       key, so a v18 snapshot carries an `agility`-keyed, dodge-less stat
 *       block; the version check rejects it outright (no migration — same
 *       stat-shape-contract rationale as GP1/GP2/H1). v18 throws on load.
 *  20 — I5 split the `melee` archetype into a family, RENAMING the key
 *       `melee → mercenary` (+ new `adventurer`/`ronin`/`bandit`). Unlike the
 *       prior bumps this is NOT a stat-shape change: a v19 snapshot carries
 *       units tagged `archetype: 'melee'`, which no longer resolves to a config
 *       — rehydrating one would crash deriving its abilities/glyph/stats. Reject
 *       outright (no migration; the renamed key has no automatic mapping). v19
 *       throws on load.
 *  21 — I6 removed `critChance` from `UnitSnapshot.derived` (the `UnitDerived`
 *       shape is stored verbatim). Crit is now resolved PER-ABILITY at attack
 *       time (`critChanceFor(ability.critBase, luck)`, gated on
 *       `ability.critable`), so the per-unit field no longer exists to
 *       serialize — the same kind of derived-field removal as E5's v12
 *       (`attackCooldownTicks`). The evadable strike actions also thread a new
 *       `accuracy` (+ `evadable`) into their serialized `actionData`; a v20
 *       mid-action snapshot would lack them. Reject v20 outright (no migration).
 *  22 — I6 commit 2 split the basic-strike ability ids: `melee_strike` → the
 *       per-subclass weapons `sword`/`club`/`katana`/`whip`, and `ranged_shot`
 *       → `bow`. `UnitSnapshot.abilities` stores the resolved id list, so a v21
 *       save carries `['melee_strike']`/`['ranged_shot']` that no longer resolve
 *       in the ability registry → `createAbility` would throw on rehydrate.
 *       Reject v21 outright (no migration; the renamed ids have no automatic
 *       mapping — same rationale as I5's archetype-key rename at v20). RunSnapshot
 *       is unaffected: roster templates carry only `archetype`, and abilities are
 *       re-resolved from the (updated) archetype config at spawn.
 *  23 — J1 added the player team's shared `objective` (a tile or an enemy unit;
 *       see `src/sim/objective.ts`) to WorldSnapshot — a mid-battle save must
 *       restore the active steering objective. A v22 save has no `objective`
 *       field; rather than default it (silently dropping a saved objective is a
 *       behavior change, not a missing-field nicety), reject v22 outright per
 *       the established no-migration contract. RunSnapshot is unaffected — the
 *       objective is World-side + transient per battle.
 *  24 — K1 added per-unit `effects` (the generic status-effect list) to
 *       `UnitSnapshot`. A v23 save has no `effects` field; defaulting it to
 *       `[]` would silently drop a saved buff/debuff (a behavior change), so
 *       reject v23 outright per the established no-migration contract. The
 *       fold is name-keyed and the base `stats` block is unchanged, so this is
 *       a purely additive per-unit field. RunSnapshot is NOT bumped by this
 *       commit — the World-side effect list is the only new state (the
 *       Run-side encounter store + fatigue migration land in K1 commit 2).
 *  25 — O1 (Phase O) replaced the single nullable player `objective`
 *       (v23's `objective: BattleObjective | null`) with a per-team,
 *       always-present typed objective (`objectives: { player, enemy }`, each a
 *       `TeamObjective` = mode + optional target; see `src/sim/objective.ts`). A
 *       v24 save carries the old `objective` field and lacks `objectives`;
 *       defaulting it would silently drop a saved steering objective (a behavior
 *       change), so reject v24 outright per the established no-migration
 *       contract. RunSnapshot is unaffected — the objective is World-side +
 *       transient per battle.
 *  26 — Y5 (the data-driven attack/effect migration) retired the per-verb action
 *       classes: a combat verb's in-flight `activeAction` now serializes as the
 *       generic `EffectActionData` (def id + cast-time ctx) instead of the legacy
 *       per-class payloads (`AttackActionData` / `MagicBoltActionData` / …), and
 *       the colliding `attack`/`heal` action-factory entries are gone. A v25 save
 *       with an in-flight melee/heal/magic/catapult/gambit/dash carries the OLD
 *       payload under the OLD action id; rehydrating it now would mis-decode (an
 *       `attack`/`heal` id throws in `abilityDef`, and gambit/dash/magic/catapult
 *       route to `EffectAction.fromData` expecting the new shape). Reject v25
 *       outright per the no-migration contract. RunSnapshot is unaffected —
 *       roster abilities are ids re-resolved at spawn, not serialized actions.
 *  27 — Phase 27 (statuses, periodic axis) added the per-unit periodic runtime
 *       state to `StatusEffect`: `nextTickAt` (the DoT/HoT tick cursor) +
 *       `sourceUnitId` (attribution). A v26 save's `effects[]` carry neither, so
 *       a mid-tick burn/bleed/poison/rejuvenate would resume with no cursor and
 *       silently stop ticking. Reject v26 outright per the no-migration contract
 *       (a pre-27 save has no periodic statuses anyway — the feature didn't
 *       exist). RunSnapshot is unaffected — statuses are World-side + transient.

   * per-action `rawDamage <= 0` / team / radius skip guards stay caller-side —
   * they decide if a cell is a victim; this method only applies a confirmed
   * hit). `opts.crit` is the already-rolled flag, forwarded to the event for
   * E6.C's red hitsplats.
   *
   * Environmental DoTs (the `burn` a fire tile applies, 27d) don't route through

   * mitigation never touches them, while still flowing through the one HP/ledger

   * a confirmed hit deals `max(STATS.minDamage, rawDamage − target.defense)`,
   * applied to the already crit/cover-resolved `rawDamage`. Both operands are
   * integers, so `final` stays integral (no re-round). The `minDamage` floor
   * keeps a high-defense target from fully negating chip/AoE.
   *
   * I2 — `opts.evadable` opts a call into the dodge to-hit roll. The caller
   * has ALREADY drawn the crit roll (in its `start`/`applyEffect`), so the
   * `combatRng` draw order is fixed at **crit → miss**: a missed strike simply
   * discards the pre-rolled crit. Only single-target strikes (melee/ranged
   * basic + the rogue gambit) pass `evadable: true`; the mage AoE, the
   * catapult, the direct-`applyDamage` tests, and environmental fire/chasm
   * damage (which bypasses this method entirely) are all unmissable — they omit
   * it (default `false`) and draw nothing here. On a miss: deal 0, emit
   * `unit:missed` (no HP mutation, no `recordDamage`, no `unit:attacked`), and
   * return before mitigation.
   *
   * I6 — `opts.accuracy` is the firing ability's per-weapon base hit chance
   * (from `config/abilities.json`), threaded by the evadable strike actions and
   * fed to `hitChanceFor` in place of the retired global `hitChanceBase`. It is
   * only consumed when `evadable` (and a live attacker exists); a missing
   * accuracy on the evadable degraded path is treated as unmissable, the same
   * as a missing attacker.
   *
   * 29 — RETURNS whether the blow LANDED: `true` on a confirmed hit (incl. the
   * unmissable / degraded paths), `false` only on an evade miss. The status-on-hit
   * `applyStatus` op reads this so a status rides a landed hit and skips a missed
   * swing (the interpreter records the miss into the per-fire scratch). Callers
