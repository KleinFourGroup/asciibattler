/**
 * Run-level state machine. Owns the meta state that survives across battles:
 * the seeded RNG, the generated NodeMap, the player roster, the current
 * position on the map, and which phase the run is in.
 *
 * Phases:
 *
 *   map ── enterNode (frontier) ──▶ battle
 *   battle ── battle:ended (player win, non-terminal) ──▶ recruit
 *   battle ── battle:ended (player win, terminal)     ──▶ complete
 *   battle ── battle:ended (enemy win)                ──▶ defeat
 *   recruit ── chooseRecruit ──▶ map
 *
 * Run does NOT construct the World. Instead it builds an Encounter snapshot
 * (worldSeed + rolled teams) and fires `battle:started`; Game owns the World
 * lifecycle and reads `run.currentEncounter` to set up the next battle.
 *
 * **A2 command channel.** Imperative inputs from the UI — entering a node,
 * picking a recruit, resetting the run — come in through `dispatch()` /
 * the `RunDispatcher` interface, not via bus events. Output notifications
 * (run:started, recruit:offered, run:victory, run:defeated) stay on the
 * bus. The split mirrors the inputs (commands) vs outputs (events)
 * distinction the rest of the codebase now keeps.
 *
 * The RNG hierarchy is the load-bearing determinism invariant: one run RNG,
 * forked once per major draw (nodeMap, starting team, each battle). The
 * forked battle stream is independent of the parent, so the run stream stays
 * byte-identical across replays of the same seed — see TESTING.md.
