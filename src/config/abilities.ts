/**
 * E5 pre-work — per-ability tunables. Source of truth at
 * `config/abilities.json`.
 *
 * Before this module, every basic strike's cadence came from the single
 * global `STATS.baseAttackCooldownSeconds`, so melee and ranged could
 * only diverge through the `speed` stat — you couldn't make a sword
 * swing faster than a bow fires without also re-pointing the whole stat
 * curve. Cadence now lives per ability: each entry's `cooldownSeconds`
 * is the base attack interval, still modulated by the unit's `speed`
 * via `cooldownScale` at propose time (see `attackCooldownTicksFor` in
 * [src/sim/stats.ts](src/sim/stats.ts)).
 *
 * E5 — `range` joins `cooldownSeconds` here. Attack range used to be a
 * per-archetype primitive (`config/archetypes.json#attackRange`) fed
 * through `deriveStats`; it now lives per ability, since a multi-ability
 * unit (E7 mage/rogue) can carry a melee swing and a long-range bolt
 * with different reaches. `proposeBasicStrike` gates on the firing
 * ability's own range; a unit's `derived.attackRange` is the MAX over
 * its abilities (its effective engagement range — see `rangeForArchetype`).
 *
 * I6 — the per-ability combat profile finally lands (the "later step"
 * the note below anticipated; I5's four melee subclasses sharing one
 * strike are the multi-consumer it waited for). An `attack`-kind ability
 * carries three numeric profile values + two boolean gates:
 *   - `might` — flat base damage/heal ADDED to the scaling stat
 *     (`damage = might + scalingStat`). Flat (a weapon constant the
 *     wielder's stat outgrows), so it's early/mid-game texture.
 *   - `accuracy` — base hit chance; REPLACES the old global
 *     `STATS.hitChanceBase` in `hitChanceFor`. Consumed only when `evadable`.
 *   - `critBase` — base crit chance folded into the luck calc
 *     (`clamp(critBase + luck·critPerLuck, 0, critCap)`). Consumed only
 *     when `critable`. Crit is resolved per-ability at attack time now, so
 *     there is no single `UnitDerived.critChance` anymore.
 *   - `evadable` — does this attack roll precision-vs-evasion to-hit? Migrates
 *     I2's hard-coded per-call-site flag into config (single-target strikes
 *     true; AoE / artillery false).
 *   - `critable` — can this attack crit at all?
 * All five are REQUIRED on an `attack`-kind ability (N1's discriminated union
 * scoped them there — the `heal` kind doesn't carry the combat profile, since
 * a heal never rolls to-hit or crit; see the union below). The damage stat an
 * ability scales on stays archetype-derived (`damageStatFor`) — scaling-stat-
 * on-the-ability is the separately-deferred basic-vs-special design.
 *
 * N1 — the config becomes a DISCRIMINATED UNION on `kind`. The single combat-
 * shaped schema forced `heal_ally` to carry dead `accuracy`/`critBase`/
 * `evadable`/`critable` it never rolls, and left a utility ability (the rogue's
 * Phase-N dash, a `movement` kind landing in N1 commit 2) with no honest home.
 * The discriminant fixes both: each `kind` declares exactly the fields it uses,
 * and the compiler forces every consumer to narrow before reading kind-specific
 * data (hence the typed `attackConfig`/`healConfig` accessors below). This is a
 * *data-shape* distinction only — the RUNTIME ability model stays flat (every
 * ability is a `propose()` returning a scored proposal; `AbilityBehavior` never
 * branches on `kind`). A new `kind` is warranted only when an ability's
 * required fields / resolution semantics diverge; optional modifiers (aoe,
 * travel, retreatDelay) stay INSIDE a kind.
 *
 * A4 pattern: parse at module load, throw on malformed JSON. The
 * registry ([src/sim/abilities/registry.ts](src/sim/abilities/registry.ts))
 * cross-checks at boot that this config and the ability factories cover
 * exactly the same id set — a registered ability with no cadence, or a
 * cadence for an unregistered ability, is a loud boot failure.
