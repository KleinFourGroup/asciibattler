/**
 * GP4 — find the nearest reachable cell from which `from` could ACT on a unit
 * at `target`: a cell `c` with `chebyshev(c, target)` in the band
 * `[minRange, range]` (O4 — `minRange` defaults 0, i.e. range-only, GP4's
 * original behavior) and (when `losBlockers` is non-null) line of sight to the
 * target. A non-zero `minRange` makes a too-close unit search for a cell FARTHER
 * out (the kiting standoff), since its own cell / near cells fail the lower
 * bound. The two callers:
 *
 *   - archers / mage  — `losBlockers` = the LOS occluders (the shot is gated);
 *   - the catapult    — `losBlockers` = null (it lobs over walls, range only).
 *
 * The caller pathfinds to the returned cell instead of to the target's own
 * cell, so a ranged unit holds at standoff with a clear shot rather than
 * charging in / creeping at a wall. (The helper is `losBlockers`-agnostic so a
 * future range-only support caller could reuse it — the healer was considered
 * but its approach is already capped at heal range by its own in-range idle,
 * so its real fix is GP5, not here.)
 *
 * Method — a bounded breadth-first search outward from `from`:
 *
 *   - **Traverses the same hard-blocker graph `findPath` uses**: in-bounds,
 *     finite `tileGrid.costAt`, and not a neutral/wall cell (built here from
 *     `world.units`). So any cell this returns is provably routable-to over
 *     that graph — `findPath(from, cell)` cannot come back empty, which is
 *     what keeps this from re-introducing the old `pickGoalCellInRange` freeze
 *     (a goal cell that was itself a wall/ally → `findPath` → `[]` → stall).
 *   - **Does NOT filter soft (unit-occupied) cells.** A transiently-occupied
 *     acting cell is still a valid *goal*: `findPath` routes toward it and the
 *     caller's in-range abstain stops the unit a cell short, before any
 *     collision. Filtering them would cause spurious fallbacks every time the
 *     ideal standoff cell is briefly occupied.
 *   - **Capped at `range + searchSlack` BFS depth.** A target beyond the cap
 *     returns null → the caller falls back to charging the target's cell (the
 *     anti-freeze guarantee); the unit snaps to the acting cell once it closes
 *     to within the cap. This bounds the per-unit-per-tick work.
 *
 * Deterministic: fixed `dx,dy = -1..1` neighbour expansion order + FIFO queue
 * → "the first qualifying cell wins" is reproducible, so the sim stays
 * byte-stable per seed.
 *
 * Returns null when no qualifying cell is reachable within the cap.

/**
 * §29d — the summon-placement query: up to `count` of the nearest UNOCCUPIED,
 * passable cells within `radiusCells` (BFS depth) of `anchor`. The sibling of
 * `nearestActingCell` — same bounded outward BFS over the same hard-blocker graph
 * (`findPath`'s: in-bounds + finite `tileGrid.costAt`) and the same deterministic
 * `dx,dy = -1..1` expansion + FIFO order, so the first free cells win
 * reproducibly. Two deliberate differences from the firing-cell search:
 *
 *   - it RETURNS cells (not a firing position), so a `summon` op drops a minion
 *     onto each — caster-anchored placement (`at:self` = adjacent to the caster).
 *   - a cell is a CANDIDATE only when UNOCCUPIED (no living unit stands on it) —
 *     a unit can't materialise onto an occupied cell — though the BFS still
 *     EXPANDS THROUGH an occupied (but passable) cell, so a summon can land on the
 *     far side of an ally. Walls / chasms (infinite cost) block both candidacy and
 *     traversal, exactly as for movement.
 *
 * Returns fewer than `count` (or `[]`) when the radius can't yield enough free
 * cells — the caller fizzles the cast (no free cell → no summon).
